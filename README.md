## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/progFilthi/backend_starter_kit.git](https://github.com/progFilthi/backend_starter_kit.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend_starter_kit
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Copy the example environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5.  **Update your `.env` file** with your specific settings (e.g., port, database URL).

### Adding a Database

This starter kit is designed for **flexible database integration**. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1.  **Choose your database** (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) and ensure it's running.
2.  **Install the appropriate driver** for your chosen database. For example, for MongoDB:
    ```bash
    npm install mongoose
    ```
3.  **Configure your database connection** in `config/database.js` by adding your connection logic.
4.  **Add your database URL** to your `.env` file:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
    ```
5.  **Create your database models** in the `models/` directory and utilize them within your `controllers/`.

---

## Usage

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  **Access your application** at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured in your `.env` file).

### Example Endpoints:

* `GET /api/health` - Check the server status.
* `POST /api/users` - Create a new user (after database setup).

Feel free to **customize routes** (`routes/`), **logic** (`controllers/`), and **services** (`services/`) to fit your application's needs.
